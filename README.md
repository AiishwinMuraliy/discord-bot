# Discord Bot ðŸ¤–

Hey! This Python script is able to send a DM to a specific user in Discord. It uses the Selenium WebDriver module and ChromeDriver to control Chrome and send the message. 
Please Note: This script is meant for Chrome. For compatibility with other search engines use the driver designed for that program.
